# Shopping Checklist Level 1

Your task is to create a shopping checklist frontend app.

The checklist should contain the following items: baby food, bacon, bread, butter, cake, ketchup, cereal, cheese, cocoa, cookies, coffee, cream, delicatess, eggs, fish, flour, frozen foor, fruit, jams, juices, matches, meats, milk, mustard, noodles, oil, onions, pepper, poultry, potatoes, rice, salt, soap, soups, spaghetti, spices, sugar, tea, vegetable, vinegar.

Each item should have a checkbox and a label.

Checkboxes state should be preserved when the page is reloaded.

After all the checkboxes were checked the app resets to original state and unchecks all the checkboxes.

## What we expect from you
1. Make the application look good.
2. Use animations where applicable (but ensure there is at least one animation).
3. Avoid duplication and extract re-usable modules where it makes sense. We want to see your approach to creating a codebase that is easy to maintain.
4. Create a new pull request, but please **do not merge it**.
5. Document the tech decisions you've made by creating a new review on your PR ([see how](https://www.loom.com/share/94ae305e7fbf45d592099ac9f40d4274)).
6. Await further instructions from the hiring team.

## Contents

- [Frontend app](app-frontend) - application files. HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- [E2E test suites](cypress/integration) - a frontend Cypress test suite. Extend with your tests.
- [Pipeline](.github/workflows/tests.yml) - a test Runner that executes the Cypress tests on push to a branch other than `master`/`main`.

## Getting started

```
npm run start # to start the app
npm run test # run Cypres tests
```

## Time estimate

Between **1h30m-3h** depending on your experience level. 

But don't worry! There is no countdown. This number is for you to plan your time.
